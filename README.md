This platform will empower users with transportation to enter information effortlessly, find the right candidates, and participate in ridesharing opportunities. It will solve transportation challenges What makes CityLink unique is its comprehensive and localized ride sharing network in the country. Unlike other databases, CityLink encourages users to share trips, split costs, and contribute to a more sustainable and connected society.
This new platform is designed for individuals seeking cost-effective and convenient intercity mobility solutions, whether for road transport or multi-city operations.

Embrace the convenience of the CityLink National Rideshare Hub – your dedicated resource for ridesharing with fellow students and community members.

# Dataset: 
The CityLink National Rideshare Hub dataset is a fictional collection of ride-sharing details meant to mirror the day-to-day operations of a ride-sharing company. It's created to help the company analyze and enhance their service by tracking rides, understanding customer preferences, and managing payments.
Basically, the dataset would include:
- Ride IDs and user IDs to keep tabs on rides and users.
- Start and end cities for each trip.
- Timings for when the rides begin.
- The number of seats offered and taken.
- The type of car being driven.
- The cost for each seat and payment details.
This data helps the company understand where and when people travel, how they like to ride, and how the business can grow and serve better.
For creating such a dataset, we're taking inspiration from existing datasets on Kaggle, which provide us with insights into car rentals and store locations. These real-world data sources help simulate a realistic service platform for CityLink.
